#when I used git push, it appeared error like "fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/WeixianHuang/Leetcodeforwork.git/': OpenSSL SSL_read: Connection was reset, errno 10054", 
and I used " git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl" "  or  git config --global http.sslVerify "false"  solved this problem.
